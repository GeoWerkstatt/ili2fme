Installing ili2fme
To install ili2fme, choose a directory and extract the distribution file there.
Copy the files and subdirectories of "${ili2fme}/FME Suite" to your FME directory.
To use ili2fme with the FME Universal Viewer, FME requires you to set an
environment variable: FME_VIEWER_THREADING=SINGLE (select Windows Start menu::Control Panel::System::Advanced::Envirnoment Variables).
Add your commonly used Interlis models to the directory "${FME}/plugins/interlis2/ilimodels".
If you run out of JAVA heap space (only the case with huge geometries; huge datasets should not be a problem), you may set FME_JVM_MAX_HEAP_SIZE and/or FME_JVM_MIN_HEAP_SIZE to some value (e.g. 1024M).
On FME versions prior to 2006GB:
Add the contents of the file "${ili2fme}/formats/formats_db-preFME2006GB.txt" to the file "${FME}/formats.db".
Add the contents of the file "${ili2fme}/formats/gallery_db-preFME2006GB.txt" to the file "${FME}/gallery.db".

How to migrate/update an existing ili2fme installation
Just copy the files and subdirectories of the new "${ili2fme}/FME Suite" to your FME directory.

Running ili2fme
ili2fme is called by FME (if you select "Swiss INTERLIS (ili2fme)" as file format).
INTERLIS 2 is read/written if you select xtf or xml as file extension.
INTERLIS 1 is read/written if you select itf as file extension.
You should read .ili files (INTERLIS 1 or 2) to import feature types into the workbench.

Limitations
- custom line forms
- XTF line attributes
- recursive structure attributes
